I was involved in architecting and rebuilding this system to fit with current technologies. Our implementation took inspiration from the Netflix API, modeling our new system as a set of microsystems.\n\nWe implemented a set of facades over these systems to expose specific functionality to specific consumers for both simplicity and security. The facade to service layers where implemented in as close to pure REST where possible, and the facade to external layers was endpoint specific. \n\nBy implementing an API in this manner we were able to both make the system future proof, as well as enabling the legacy system to integrate with the new system without crippling the new system. \n\nIn addition to the architecture migration, I was also lead on the creation of a new service to provide video interviewing to our clients. The application was developed to integrate seamlessly with the legacy platform while being built with the new architecture. It allows Revelian’s clients to set up one way video interviews for prospective employees, have multiple people review and rate each response, and make hire recommendations, which produced reports and had a rating system which fed back into the existing system for integration into the full suite of Revelian products and hiring process.\n\nThe system architecture is built with Java for the micro services and facades, and NodeJS and AngularJS serving the front end UI's. The infrastructure is all AWS, from S3 buckets for content storage, private zones, route53, cloud formation for deployment, security groups, load balancing etc.",
